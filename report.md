# Cybersecurity OSWAP Juice Shop Report
## Introduction

In this demo, I chose to use OSWAP Juice Shop as a target to experiment with Burp and other tools by doing the offered challenges. Initially, I tried to solve the challenges on my own by thinking about the solutions I thought about how to solve the challenges, but I had to use online tutorials to help me with the technical part.

This report is organized in:
- Challenges name followed by the description and the solution.
- The order of the challenges in the report corresponds to the order of the challenges in the demo.
- The tools I used for writing the report and building the demo are listed at the end of the page.
